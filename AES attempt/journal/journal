Today I have started to research modern and historical cryptography. I have decided to attempt the
AES cipher. Whether or not I will be successful is still unknown. By the weekend I have to fully 
comprehend the AES cipher.

Today I am continuing my research on the AES encryption process. Realizing that this encryption does 
byte manipulation, I have begun to look up Java's byte manipulation capabilities.

Today I have started to build the "skeleton" of my AES encrypter. I have decided on using 16 bit 
encryption, which will only require 10 rounds. Also attempted to start to write the block functions
of AES( the hardest task).
