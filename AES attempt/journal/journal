5/04/2017: 
Today I have started to research modern and historical cryptography. I have decided to attempt the
AES cipher. Whether or not I will be successful is still unknown. By the weekend I have to fully 
comprehend the AES cipher.
5/05/2017:
Today I am continuing my research on the AES encryption process. Realizing that this encryption does 
byte manipulation, I have begun to look up Java's byte manipulation capabilities. 
5/08/2017:
Today I have started to build the "skeleton" of my AES encrypter. I have decided on using 16 bit 
encryption, which will only require 10 rounds. Also attempted to start to write the block functions
of AES( the hardest task).
5/09/2017:
Today I'm trying to replicate the shiftRow function
5/11/2017:
Still attempting to complete AES encryption method. 
5/12/2017:
Today I am learning about Galois fields for AES encryption.
5/15/2017:
Today I am continuing to learn about Galois fields and the MixColumns function of the AES algorithm
5/16/2017:
Today I have hit a slight roadblock. The implementation of AES was in C++, so I am currently trying to
wrap my head around what exactly a char is in C++/Java.
5/17/2017:
I have learned that a char is a representation of character. It can also be saved as ASCII code, which
is represented in a byte. That helps with my understanding of why you implement AES like so. 
Unfortunately I have yet to complete the algorithm, so I can't test it yet.
5/22/2017:
Today I am finished the MixColumns step. Now trying to work on the key expansion step of AES. 
If I completed it properly, the AES should work as intended
5/23/2017:
Today I took a slight detour from my project to watch a TED talk on block chains. The concept of block
chains seems rather innovative, given the possibilities with secure payments and privatization
of self creations.
